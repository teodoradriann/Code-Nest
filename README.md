# Code Nest

**Code Nest** is a lightweight and efficient Swift code editor designed for rapid execution and seamless development. It features real-time output visualization, syntax highlighting, and an intuitive interface for navigating errors efficiently.

The editor provides essential functionalities such as saving the current code state and loading external code files directly into the workspace.

## Performance & Reliability

Code Nest leverages **multithreading** to execute code in parallel, ensuring that the editor remains responsive even while running intensive computations. Additionally, it incorporates advanced memory management techniques to detect and handle infinite loops, preventing potential memory leaks or application freezes by automatically terminating unresponsive processes.

## Important Notice

To enable code execution within the application, **App Sandbox** must be disabled. This can be done by navigating to **Signing & Capabilities** in the project settings and removing the **App Sandbox** entitlement.
